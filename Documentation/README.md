Argo allows you to easily decode loosely typed structures into strongly typed
models. When paired with functional programming concepts, Argo, becomes a
beautiful way to decode JSON from network responses into your application
models. The following guides will show you how to use Argo and how powerful it
can be.

- Decoding your first model: This takes you through a few simple cases of using
  Argo.
- Functional Primer: This helps introduce the functional concepts used in Argo.
- `<|`, `<|?`, `<||`, `<||?`: This dives deeper into the custom operators used
  in Argo.
- More complex examples: Take a look at some more complex examples we've found.
- Using without Functional Programming: Don't want to dive into FP just yet?
  Check this out.
- No custom operators!: Also not into custom operators? We've got you!
